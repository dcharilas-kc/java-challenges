# Fun with Strings - Part 1
 
##  Longest Palindromic Substring
Challenge is available at: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

**Example 1:**
`Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.`

**Example 2:**
`Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"`

## Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Challenge is available at: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.


**Example 1:**
`Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.`

**Example 2:**
`Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.`

**Example 3:**
`Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.`


**Constraints:**
- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

**Guidelines:**
Put all code inside `LongestWithoutRepeat` class.
