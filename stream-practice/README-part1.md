# Stream Practice - Part 1

1) Define a stream operation that computes the number of elements in an instance of an `IntStream` without using `count()`. 


2) Define a stream operation that when applied to an instance of an `IntStream` returns a stream with all elements incremented by one.


3) Define a stream operation that computes the sum of all positive elements in an instance of an `IntStream`.  


4) Define a stream operation that when applied to an instance of an `IntStream`, returns a stream with only the positive values (zeroes and all negative elements removed) without using `filter()`. Hint: try `flatMap()`. 


5) Define a stream operation sequence based on a reduce operation to concatenate all strings in a `Stream<Strings>`.
