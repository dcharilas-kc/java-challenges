**Welcome to Java Challenges!**   

This is a series of puzzles and exercises to sharpen our Java skills. Some will require an algorithmic solution, while others with focus on specific Java aspects.

**Generic Guidelines:**  

- If challenge is retrieved from a site with the capability to submit for testing, it is advised to put all code in a single class.
- In that case, it is not enough to solve the challenge locally. Submit the solution to the site to verify it's accepted!
- Do not add libraries in pom, unless the challenge asks to do so.
- Use Java 11
- Only few basic tests are provided as part of the exercise. Feel free to add any tests you find useful.
- You can push additional tests and challenges in `main` branch. However, please do not push the solutions there. You can either push them in `solution` branch or create you own personal branch.
